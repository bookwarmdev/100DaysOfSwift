//  Now that you understand how protocols and extensions work,
//  itâ€™s time to pause our learning and take on a challenge so you can put it all into practice.

//  Your challenge is this: make a protocol that describes a building,
//  adding various properties and methods, then create two structs, House and Office,
//  that conform to it. Your protocol should require the following:

//  A property storing how many rooms it has.
//  A property storing the cost as an integer (e.g. 500,000 for a building costing $500,000.)
//  A property storing the name of the estate agent responsible for selling the building.
//  A method for printing the sales summary of the building, describing what it is along with its other properties.

    func costing() -> String {
        return "$\(self)"
